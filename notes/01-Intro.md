# PERL (Practical Extraction Reporting Language)

- PERL is a modular language which interprets through the program. 
- In PERL for printing anything we need to use `print` statement.
- It is very important to terminate each statement with a semi-colon `;`.
- We will be using some quotes might be single or double as per our requirement and these works as same like in ***Bash***
